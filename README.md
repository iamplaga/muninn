The goal is to deploy this on a Raspberry Pi and have it alert you if a new device enters your network &amp; to add features in the future. I've run into a few issues, one is SSH detection due to different ports can be used, and widening the net leads to false positives. 

I'm sure this has been done before but between learning Python and creating something that is not too technical not to mention putting a Raspberry Pi to use, I hope this becomes useful to someone other than me.
